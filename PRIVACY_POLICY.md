# Privacy Policy

Effective date: October 6, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the **Travel Journal** mobile application ("App") handles your information, including recent additions: on-device voice transcription and a weather feature.

## 1. Data Collection
- The App stores entries, notes, photos, and optional location data **only locally** on your device.
- No personal information is transmitted to servers owned by us.
- Location data may be used for two purposes:
  - to attach a place to your entries (optional, user-initiated), and
  - to fetch current weather for UI visuals (see Section 4).

## 2. Data Usage
- Your data remains private and accessible only on your device.
- Location information is used to display coordinates or a human-readable place in your journal and, if enabled, to fetch current weather.
- Photos you attach stay on your device and are linked to your entries.

## 3. Microphone and Local Transcription (On‑device)
- If you enable voice notes, the App uses an on‑device speech‑to‑text model (Whisper Tiny via Executorch) to convert speech to text.
- A one‑time model download (~75–100 MB) is stored locally on your device for offline/on‑device use.
- Your audio is processed on the device; audio is **not uploaded** to our servers.
- Transcribed text is only saved where you choose (e.g., within a note/entry) and remains local.

## 4. Location and Weather
- With your permission, the App may access your device location to show local weather and adapt UI animations/gradients.
- To retrieve weather, the App calls the OpenWeatherMap API and transmits approximate coordinates (latitude/longitude). No persistent identifiers are sent by us.
- Weather responses are cached locally for a short period (about 10 minutes) to reduce network requests.
- If you deny location permissions, the weather feature is disabled.

## 5. Permissions
The App may request the following permissions:
- **Camera** – capture photos for entries.
- **Photo Library** – select existing photos.
- **Location** – attach coordinates to entries and obtain local weather.
- **Microphone** – record audio for on‑device transcription.

You can use the App without granting some permissions, but related features will be unavailable.

## 6. Third Parties
- Weather data is provided by OpenWeatherMap. Your device may send latitude/longitude to their API solely for retrieving weather.
- The App does not use analytics or advertising SDKs.

## 7. Data Retention and Deletion
- Entries, notes, photos, and cached weather are stored locally. You may delete entries/photos at any time from within the App.
- The speech model file is stored locally to enable offline/on‑device transcription and is removed when you uninstall the App. You can clear the app’s storage to remove cached files.
- Uninstalling the App removes all locally stored data created by the App.

## 8. Children’s Privacy
This App is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 9. Changes
We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Updates will be reflected in this document with a new effective date.
